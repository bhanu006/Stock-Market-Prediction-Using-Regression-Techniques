# Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-Regression-Techniques
Stock Market Prediction - The goal of our work is to collect the stock price of Facebook over a period of time and develop a model for forecasting the future stock price values. We hypothesize that it is possible for a machine learning model to learn from the features of the past movement patterns of a dataset and these learned features can be effectively exploited in accurately forecasting the future stock price values. We will be using algorithms such as Linear Regression , Ridge Regression , KNN, Random Forest to predict the future Adj.Close price of Facebook Stocks. To validate our hypothesis we will be comparing the R2 obtained from the Machine Learning Algorithms.
